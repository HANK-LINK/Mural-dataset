# Data-for-PGM

This repository contains a large mural dataset. If you need to use our data, please cite our paper; for specific data details, please refer to the relevant paper.

PGMv1：Progressive generative mural image restoration based on adversarial structure learning.

To accommodate the needs of different users, we have divided the mural dataset into a Base version and an expert version. Due to file size limitations required by GitHub, we have stored the specific data layers in a cloud drive. The specific cloud drive link and corresponding key are stored in the PDF document corresponding to that version.

The base version of the dataset consists of 774 cleaned, 720×720 original mural images.

The expert version of the dataset consists of 6,800 512×512 mural images and 6,800 corresponding expert line drawings.
